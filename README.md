- 👋 Hi, I’m @marvanyzsolt
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. Maybe it's the midlife crisis but I want to try new things - including programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science and not yet decided the longer term direction. AI and web development also seems interesting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... er... I don't know yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: drop a mail to mr.marble@gmail.com 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started coding on my C64 ages ago... first basic, then assembly. Later in high school I had learned Pascal, DBase and other ancient languages - but my life had changed track before getting involved to the then-new-concept oop.
